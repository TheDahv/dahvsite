As a product manager, I need a way to keep track of my various projects and
investments. More importantly, I want to maintain the proper blend of
projects for exploring new ideas and exploiting existing ones. I will show you
a simple tool I'm using to keep track.

I arrived at the product management track in an interesting way. I've been a
software engineer for last 10 years or so. Most of that was in startups or small
organizations &mdash; places where it is important to work in a
cross-functional way. In that time, I realized the cross-functional work and
customer research I was doing as an engineer typically described what product
managers did. So I pursued that further.

I committed to learning more about product management as a formal role and I've
been learning ever since. Because of my background, I'm currently working as a
"technical project manager" &mdash; a role that blends my experience with
technology and digital solutions with my passion for working with customers.

I spend a lot of time exploring unvetted technologies and identifying
intersections between product and innovation. I also spend time paired with
other product managers and engineering teams to consult and provide ideas for
managing our existing prducts.

Organizations and individuals alike have an ideal balance of exploring new
opportunities and exploiting existing investments. Regardless of your path to
product management, you probably have a few balance points for that mix as well:

- a mix balancing the needs of the organization at the current time
- a mix describing your ideals for growth and learning
- a mix distributing the right talent to the right problems

I like to think of this mix as a product manager's project portfolio. It's a
helpful tool to show you where you are spending your time with respect to your
goals. It is a way to assess with your manager or leadership if your time is
allocated in harmony with the needs of the business.

What I like the most is it quickly visualizes if you or the organization is
over-indexing in one area at the expense of another. I think this matters for
the health of your team as much as it does for the health of your career. A
visualization helps you have that conversation.

So here is how I think about mine. I strike 2 axes along which I can think about
any given project or investment of my time:

- Maintaining/Managing vs. Exploring/Inventing
- Responsible vs. Consulting

For the first axis, I'm describing whether something I'm doing helps push the
company into new areas. This is work that usually looks like research and
design, rapid prototyping, customer interviews, and so on. But most important,
I'm not iterating on anything existing at the company. The other end of the axis
describes activities where I may be innovating in an existing product, or
working with a team to solve a problem within the product.

The other axis describes my relationship to the work. I like the [responsibility
assignment
matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) &mdash;
commonly known as RACI &mdash; to describe anybody's relationship to a piece of
work. In my current role, I'm either leading the charge on something or I'm
pairing with another product manager to navigate technical aspects of the
problem. I simplify it as projects where I'm consulting rather than directly
responsible for the outcome. I have more capacity for the former than
the latter, so it helps me see where I'm overloaded or underutilized.

Plotting these 2 axes in a visualization gives me 4 quadrants. This describes my
project portfolio mix. I use the distance from the centroid of the graph to
indicate how actively a project is consuming my time. Projects that only need
1-5 hours of my attention per week are farther away. I prioritize my attention
for active projects and move them toward the middle.

In my visualization, you may notice I have different color circles to represent
the projects. This may not apply to you, but my role is a blend of disciplines.
In some projects, I act more as a technical consult &mdash; sometimes writing
code if necessary &mdash; but I want these to be a relatively smaller allocation
in my portfolio. In some other projects, I am working with an engineer or data
scientist to evaluate a new capability or data source to determine its value to
customers. These are speculative and nascent, so I mark them as "research/data
science". The last chunk of work is where I am working as a product manager.

There is a separate space in my visualization where I track potential projects.
I can anticipate what kind of portfolio mix I want to build as I complete
projects and the needs of the company change.

I made my project portfolio using a tool called [Miro](https://miro.com/). I can
share this with my manager to discuss in our 1:1s. I can also share it with my
team and anyone is welcome to leave comments or ask questions. If you use Miro,
look for the "what's on your radar" template.

This is a helpful communication tool to help people understand how I'm spending
my time in accordance with strategic needs. I hope you will find some value
for yourself as well.
