[My Business Console](https://moz.com/blog/my-business-console-free-tool) was a
quick-response project released in 2016 by Moz to fill a gap left in Google's
"Google My Business" interface.

Many business owners and the agencies supporting them use Google My Business
(GMB) to create a presence for their business on Google -- especially on Google
Maps. They can also use GMB to control manage access to their business listings
to share management to their team members.

For large brands and for agencies serving multiple business accounts,
performing these actions in bulk was overly cumbersome. However, we saw an
opportunity to use the GMB API to help automate some of these features.

We worked rapidly -- moving from concept to design to release -- to build a bulk
account management tool in a matter of weeks. Though this wasn't in Moz' direct
line of business, we were frequent users of the GMB API to power our own
products. We were able to build this as a service to local SEO community and
released it as a free tool to customers and non-customers alike.

GMB has evolved a lot since then and the tool has since been retired.
