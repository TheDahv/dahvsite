summary: A brief update on my What's For Dinner project
---

I didn't get a ton of time to work on [What's For Dinner](http://dinnerplanner.herokuapp.com) this week, but I just submitted a couple feature updates.

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, you should probably read [this](/whats-for-dinner) first.

# Keyboard Save Shortcut

I tend to save after every line or sentence when I'm writing or coding. This just feels like a good habit to me. The general usage of What's For Dinner is to add in some information and then submit it so that the other person can see what you wrote. Rather than taking your hands off the keys to submit your changes, you can type `<ctrl> s` to save a change. This will submit the form and refresh your page, thereby pulling in any other changes.

Unfortunately, if your page was out of date when you submitted, you're likely to clobber any other changes. This is a deficiency in the tool, and I have a plan to fix it.

For now, be sure to commit early, refresh often, and have fun. I'll let you know when other things are fixed.

# Ingredients Section

You may notice that the ingredients section is gone. I haven't even started on that feature, so it doesn't make sense to have it up there. I've hidden this section in CSS until it's ready.

# What I Need From You

Keep playing with it and let me know what issues you find or what feature requests you have. I've been saving all my ideas on the [issues page](https://github.com/TheDahv/whatsfordinner/issues) for the project, but you can leave an idea in the comments and I'll make sure I look at them sometime.

Another thing I need help with is testing. For example, I was only able to test the keyboard save shortcut in Chrome and Firefox 3 on Linux. If the feature doesn't work for you, please let me know which browser version and OS you are using and I can check it out.

Thanks!
