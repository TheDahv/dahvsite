      <h1>I Build Things</h1>
      <p>
        Whether it is building a strong family, getting involved
        in my community, leading teams through projects, or hacking on software, I love
        building and creating
      </p>

      <p>
        When it comes to my professional life, my history paints me first as a technical program
        manager, then a software engineer, then a web developer, and finally as a cross-team,
        "make things happen" technical director.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, I like to think of myself as a hard-working kid lucky enough to know how to
        help people turn their ideas into software experiences.
